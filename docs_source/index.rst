Welcome to mer's documentation!
===============================
Mars-Earth retimer (mer) is a package for converting between Martian times and
Earth times. You may be interested in this package if:

* you're sick of people's logic-defying insistence to refer to Martian events
  in Earth times, so you want a way to convert Earth times to Martian times
  (who cares that a dust storm started April 10---a date that provides
  absolutely no physically relevant info---you just want to know the
  L\ :sub:`s` when it started), or
* you think in Martian times and begrudgingly have to give Earth dates and/or
  times to others.

If either of these apply to you, this package is for you.
