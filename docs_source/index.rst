Welcome to mer's documentation!
===============================
Mars-Earth retimer (mer) is a package for converting between Martian times and
Earth times. You may be interested in this package if

* you're sick of people's logic-defying insistence to refer to Martian events
  in Earth times (who cares that a dust storm started April 10---a date that
  provides absolutely no physically relevant info---you just want to know the
  L\ :sub:`s` when it started), so you want a way to convert Earth times to
  Martian times
* you think in Martian times and want to give Earth dates and/or times to the
  mission ops people.

If either of these apply to you, this package is for you.
